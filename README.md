For Chapter 1, I conducted sensitivity analysis using 1000 combinations of ($\lambda', \sigma_r, \sigma_\alpha$) where $\lambda'$ is the mean introdcution rate \sigma_r,$ is the standard deviation of intrinsic growth rates and $\sigma_\alpha$ is the standard deviation for interactions strength. Each combination was simulated for 1800 time steps and then calculate the of the last 1000 observations per each variable.   

For Chapter 2, I conducted sensitivity analysis using 24001 combinations of ($\sigma_r, \sigma_\alpha, \lambda'_A,\lambda'_P$). Each combination was simulated for 1800 time steps and then calculate the of the last 1000 observations per each variable.
